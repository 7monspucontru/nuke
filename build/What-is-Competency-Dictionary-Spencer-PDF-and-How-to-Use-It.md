A competency dictionary is a tool that defines the skills, knowledge and abilities required for different jobs or functions in an organization. It helps to align the human resources practices with the strategic goals and objectives of the organization. A competency dictionary can include general competencies that are common to all jobs, as well as technical or functional competencies that are specific to certain jobs or roles.

One of the most comprehensive and widely used competency dictionaries is the one developed by Lyle and Signe Spencer, based on their extensive research and consulting experience. Their competency dictionary is presented in their book *Competence at Work: Models for Superior Performance*, which was published in 1993. The Spencer competency dictionary covers 20 generic competencies that are grouped into five clusters: achievement and action, helping and human service, impact and influence, managerial, and cognitive.
  
The Spencer competency dictionary also provides behavioral indicators for each competency at different levels of proficiency, ranging from level 1 (basic) to level 5 (expert). These indicators help to measure and assess the competency level of individuals or groups, as well as to design and implement competency-based human resources interventions such as selection, training, performance management, career development and succession planning.
  
The Spencer competency dictionary is available in PDF format online, which makes it easy to access and use. However, it is important to note that the Spencer competency dictionary is not a one-size-fits-all solution. It may need to be adapted or customized to suit the specific needs and context of each organization. For example, some competencies may be more relevant or critical than others for certain jobs or functions, or some competencies may need to be added or modified to reflect the current trends or challenges in the industry or sector.
  
Therefore, before using the Spencer competency dictionary, it is advisable to conduct a thorough job analysis and competency modeling process to identify the key competencies required for each job or function in the organization. This process should involve multiple stakeholders such as managers, employees, customers and experts, as well as multiple sources of data such as interviews, surveys, observations and documents. The resulting competency model should be validated and updated regularly to ensure its accuracy and relevance.
  
The Spencer competency dictionary is a valuable resource for any organization that wants to implement a competency-based approach to human resources management. It provides a comprehensive and research-based framework for defining and developing competencies that can enhance individual and organizational performance. However, it should not be used as a rigid or static template. Rather, it should be used as a flexible and dynamic guide that can be tailored and refined according to the specific needs and context of each organization.
